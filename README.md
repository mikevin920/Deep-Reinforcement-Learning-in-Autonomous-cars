# Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Game-Theoretic Decision-Making for Autonomous Vehicles"
* This Project implements game-theoretic decision-making with deep reinforcement learning alogrithms such as D3QN, DDPG and SAC for autonomous vehicles in a realistic simulator(ROS-Gazebo).
* Vehicles can make decisions at unsignalized intersections soley based on their own 2D-LIDAR observations, using Tensorflow and ROS.
* Succesfully modelled multiple vehicles in a complex interaction scenarios simultaneously as decision makers with conservative, aggressive, and adaptive driving behaviors. 
* Improved the success rate for all four vehicles passing through the intersection without collision by 30%
