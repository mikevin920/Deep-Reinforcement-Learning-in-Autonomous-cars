# Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Game-Theoretic Decision-Making for Autonomous Vehicles"
* This Project creates simulator for muti-agent reinforcement learning in Autonomous Vehicles.
* Implemented game-theoretic decision-making with deep reinforcement learning alogrithms such as D3QN, DDPG and SAC.
* Using Tensorflow and ROS, vehicles are allowed to make decisions at unsignalized intersections only based on their own 2D-Lidar Observations.
* Succesfully Modelled multiple vehicles in a complex interaction scenarios simultaneously as decision makers with conservative, aggressive, and adaptive driving behaviors. 
* Improved the success rate for all four vehicles passing through the intersection without collision by 30%
